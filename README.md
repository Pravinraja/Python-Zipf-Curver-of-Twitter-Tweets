# Python-Zipf-Curver-of-Twitter-Tweets
In Simple terms Zipf is an empirical law that states that given a large enough sample size, like a novel, the frequency of an individual word is inversely proportional to the rank of the word. Today we will do this on Python using Twitter tweets of popular people. Make sure you have a twitter account and developer portal setup

Using the given code harvest_twitter.py Download harvest_twitter.py, make 3 corpora of 3 different twitter users (try to make them from different genres, politics, celebrity, sports etc.)

Calculate the frequency of the unigrams
Sort the frequency list
Plot the zipf curve
For each of the 3 users, see if they follow a traditional zipf curve (check the log graph). If there are any difference, make note of them.
Turn in your code and screenshots of the plots.
